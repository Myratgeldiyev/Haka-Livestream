# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## SVGA (emoji animations)

- **Daily development / Expo Go:** Do not set `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_SVGA`. The native SVGA player is not loaded, so you avoid the "View config not found for RNSvgaPlayer" crash; emoji picker and overlay use placeholders/fallbacks.
- **Build with native SVGA:** To show SVGA animations in the built app, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NATIVE_SVGA=1` in `.env` or in `app.config.js`, then run `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo run:android` (or run:ios). In that build the native SVGA player is loaded and animations appear in the picker and overlay.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
